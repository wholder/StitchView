## StitchView
This code allows you to view .pes, .dst and .exp format embroidery files. From the command line type:

    java -jar StitchView.jar file.dxf
    
Then, use the slider and the left/right arrows under the view area rewind the stitches or more forward again.  While the slider is selected, the left/right arrow keys will also control it.
